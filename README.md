# WebGL-Adventure
It's Web GL time!

This is a project that I started to learn some webgl and javascript.

My first task was to create a rendering system that makes it easy to add elelents to a scene.


You can see my progress at my github pages for this repo(http://alexmerritt.github.io/WebGL-Adventure/).
